Hey, you did it! This block only appears if you set up an access token and rendered the README locally.

This AsciiDoctor extension lets you include files directly from remote GitHub repositories. It will only affect include directives for URIs beginning with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`.

== Installation

With Ruby Gems:

    gem install asciidoctor-github-include

== Usage

=== Command line

Load the extension, and pass a GitHub https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[personal access token] as an attribute named `github-access-token`:

    asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-github-include -a github-access-token=yourtoken [file.adoc]

Then, inside your AsciiDoc file, use an `include` statement like normal, pointing to a URI that begins with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you set up an access token (by setting the `github-access-token` attribute), it must be a *valid* access token--even for accessing public repos. This is because GitHub returns 404 on all requests that pass invalid tokens.

If `github-access-token` is left undefined, however, fetching from public repositories will still work.
====

== Examples

=== Basic

Save this 1-line Asciidoc file as `readme.adoc`:

----
\include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkfu/asciidoctor-github-include/master/README.adoc[]
----

Then run

    asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-github-include -a github-access-token=yourtoken readme.adoc

and open `readme.html` in your browser. You should be looking at this readme!

=== Retrieve specific branches using attributes

A useful way to set up your AsciiDoc file when using asciidoctor-github-include is something like this:

----
= GitHub Use
:repo-stem: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/my_username/my_private_repo
:ref: master
:my_private_repo: {snippet-source}/{ref}

\include::{my_private_repo}/path/to/included.adoc[]
----

Then, generate the doc:

    asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-github-include -a github-access-token=yourtoken [file.adoc]

Later on, you may want to generate docs from a different branch. For that, you can override the `ref` attribute from the command line:

    asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-github-include -a github-access-token=yourtoken -a ref=v1.2.3 [file.adoc]

Valid values for `ref` here are anything that works for `git checkout`: a branch name, a tag, or a commit SHA.

=== Use this extension with Jekyll

One of the reasons this extension exists is to allow the easy generation of Jekyll-based documentation sites that need to fetch resources from various other git repos. However, you can't pass attributes into jekyll-asciidoc from the command line. To work around this, we use a secondary, secret config file.

==== Prerequisites

In your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'jekyll-asciidoc'
    gem 'asciidoctor-github-include'

In your `_config.yml`:

    plugins:
      - jekyll-asciidoc
      - asciidoctor-github-include

In a new file called `_secret.yml`:

    asciidoctor:
      attributes:
        github-access-token: yourtoken

`yourtoken` is a https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[personal access token for command line usage] that you've generated.

In your `.gitignore`:

    _secret.yml

==== Generating the site

Pass the secret config file to `jekyll build`:

    jekyll build --config _config.yml,_secret.yml
